EditorConfigâ€”TextMate PlugIn
============================

This is a TextMate plug-in that provides support for [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/). It will cause TextMate to set its editing features (e.g. tab style and size) according to a `.editorconfig` file you include alongside your source code.

Download it now at: https://github.com/Mr0grog/editorconfig-textmate/releases/latest

Only some features are support in TextMate 1 (all features work in TextMate 2). TM1 support may be removed in the near future, though older builds that support it will continue to be downloadable.


Feature Support
---------------

The following Editor Config features are supported:

- root
- indent_style ("tab" or "space")
- indent_size
- tab_width
- insert_final_newline (newline is added when saving a document)
- trim_trailing_whitespace (whitespace is trimmed when saving a document)

The `end_of_line` and `charset` features are not yet supported (see #23 for tracking).


Installation
------------

You can download a precompiled binary from:
